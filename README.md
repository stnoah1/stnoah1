### :wave: Hi, I am Hyung-gun Chi [[Homepage](https://hyung-gun.me/)]

I am a **PhD** student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering at **Purdue University** advised by Professor Karthik Ramani. My research interests lie at the intersection of **Computer Vision** and Robotics, focusing on 3D Geometric Deep Learning for recognizing and synthesizing 3D objects. In this area, I applied Machine Learning (Deep Learning) algorithms for **Augmented/Virtual Reality** and Smart Factory.
